    - CRITICAL: For the music link, you MUST create a YouTube Music search URL. Do not, under any circumstances, link to a specific YouTube video (youtube.com/watch?v=...). Direct video links are forbidden because they break easily. The ONLY correct format is a search link: 'https://music.youtube.com/search?q=QUERY', where QUERY is the URL-encoded artist and song title.
    - If, and only if, a song is a terrible fit, you may recommend a highly relevant 'article' that offers a practical tool, a new perspective, or a comforting story.
